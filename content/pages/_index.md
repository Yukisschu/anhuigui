Hi!:waving_hand: My name is Anhui Gui. I graduated with a Master's degree in Business Administration: Digital Business from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). Previously, I studied Computer Science: Financial Big Data Analysis (for 1 year), International Economics and Trade, and Accounting: CPA in bachelor's studies at [Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi_University_of_Finance_and_Economics).

My research focuses on advancing the application of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to comprehensively understand dynamic user patterns and the underlying factors in online data from digital platforms. In my research, I integrate expertise and knowledge from data science, business, and social science and utilise various NLP/LLMs and statistical methods to gain a thorough understanding of the subject.

<b>Here are some fun facts about me in my daily life :grinning_cat::</b>
- Open-minded and always curious about new things
- Enjoy nature and haphazard journeys
- Red pandas are too cute 
- Coffee and bubble tea are my go-to drinks
- Keen on reading and baking
- An enthusiastic video gamer (Dota2)
  
Also, I am really into programming, and I believe that sharing knowledge would greatly accelerate the development process. Therefore, I am writing beginner-friendly tutorials with more details from a learnerâ€™s perspective, and I also try to openly share my code whenever possible.
