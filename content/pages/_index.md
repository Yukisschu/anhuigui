Hi!:waving_hand: My name is Anhui Gui. I am a recent graduate with a master's degree in Digital Business from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

Before this, I studied Computer Science, International Economics, and CPA during my bacherlor's studies.

My research interest revolves around studying online information and user behaviour on social media. My goal is to promote the application of advanced machine learning techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of user patterns and the underlying factors behind online data, with a focus on the mental health field.

My research approach combines a range of expertise, incorporating various machine learning algorithms and statistical methods, and is enriched by multidisciplinary industry-specific insights to delve deep into the studies.

<b>Some fun facts about me:</b>
- Open-minded and always curious about new things
- Enjoy haphazard journeys
- Coffee and bubble tea are my go-to drinks
- Keen on reading and baking
- An enthusiastic video gamer (Dota2)
- Red Panda lover 
  
I am really into programming, and I genuinely think that sharing what we know can make the development process much better. I also want to speed up this process. Therefore, I am working on making beginner-friendly programming tutorials based on what I know, and I try to share my code openly whenever I can.
