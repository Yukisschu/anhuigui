Hi!:waving_hand: My name is Anhui Gui. I am a recent graduate with a master's degree in Digital Business from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en).

My research interest revolves around studying online information and user behaviour on social media. My goal is to promote the application of advanced machine learning techniques for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of user patterns and the underlying factors behind the online data.

My research approach combines a range of expertise, incorporating various machine learning algorithms and statistical methods, and is enriched by multidisciplinary industry-specific insights to delve deep into the studies.

I am always deeply intrigued by programming, and here are the list of some projects (link) I have done. And I also deeply believe that sharing of knowledge can extensively boost the development process and I also aspire to accelerate the Web decentralization process, therefore I am working on composing entry-level tutorials for programming (link) to the limitation of my knowledge, and open-source my codes whenever possible.

In my daily life, I love baking, reading, and exploring new places.
