Mental disorder is a significant global concern, and filling the gaps in knowledge about it is imperative. By analysing the behaviours of relevant individuals on social media platforms like Reddit, we can understand it better and offer suggestions on how we can collectively improve global mental health.
<!--
This project focuses on fine-tuning the state-of-the-art deep learning model BERT for the purpose of detecting individuals with suicide tendencies on X (formally known as Twitter). Subsequently, the negative binomial regression model is applied to delve into the intricate relationships among suicidal tendencies, emotional dimensions, and engagement levels.

Web app for data collection, prediction, emotion analysis, and topic analysis on Reddit with interactive visualisations.

The aim of Red Panda is to:

- Integrate machine learning models, including the SuiBERT prediction model, BERTopic topic clustering model, as well as emotion and engagement measurement models, to uncover patterns from evolving multi-modal data (involving images, videos, or other sensor data) in mental health-related subreddits.

- Create and deploy a web-based visual analytics tool that can display the summarised insights to stakeholders and collect different forms of feedback interactively.

- Improve machine learning models using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

- Generate logs to document the dynamic patterns and develop customised digital health solutions.
