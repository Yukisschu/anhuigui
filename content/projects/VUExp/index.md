I participated in a brain and behaviour experiment examining short-term and long-term memories for briefly flashed images with a short stimulus presentation time lasting 50 ms, as well as the impact of colour on the results. I was asked to recognise if any of the grayscale pictures in the test set (160 pairs for short-term and 480 pairs for long-term) had been presented in the previous colour picture sets; a black or coloured dot would be given in between. My records showed 100% accuracy for the first set of short-term trial tests, 90% accuracy for formal short-term memory tests, and 75% accuracy for long-term memory tests on average.

From my perspective, I don't find colour helped in recognising the test pictures, especially given the short presentation time, grayscale test sets, and large quantity. Particularly during the long-term memory test, I relied heavily on intuition and feeling. During the short-term test, I attempted to leverage hints from the coloured dot, but then my brain shifted to focus solely on remembering the shapes of pictures, believing it would improve accuracy.

As someone not familiar with the brain and behaviour field, upon briefly reviewing previous research, I noticed that some scholars believe colour aids in memorisation by increasing attention levels. The role of colour in enhancing attention is indisputable. More attention focused on certain stimuli increases the likelihood of their transfer to permanent memory storage (Dzulkifli & Mustafar, 2013) [^1]. Considering this, I wonder if it would be better to show the colour hint dot before presenting the coloured picture sets to allow for more attention to be given to that specific colour, thereby increasing the stimuli transferred to memory. Conversely, if the colour hint is only shown afterward, the memory process has already passed.

While composing this post, I came across an article from Nature Brief that illustrates how studies in mice reveal that when long-term memories are formed, the DNA in some nerve cells undergoes damage, triggering an immune response responsible for repair. This DNA damage-and-repair cycle might be a way for nerve cells to form lasting memories [^2]. It's fascinating to see this process through another domain, so let me also capture this concept here.

In conclusion, participating in experiments across different domains is very fun, and I believe interdisciplinary experiences will be beneficial in my future studies at some point. By sharing my thoughts and experiences, though they may not all be correct, I also hope they can be helpful to researchers in relevant studies.
