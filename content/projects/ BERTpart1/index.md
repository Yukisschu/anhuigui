Suicide is a major global concern, causing over 700,000 deaths annually. Suicide behaviour can be effectively prevented by implementing evidence-based interventions on at-risk individuals. Thus, accurately detecting signs of suicidality and thoroughly understanding suicidal behaviour is crucial for developing proactive and effective prevention strategies. However, due to the sensitive and multifaceted nature of suicide, obtaining adequate information through traditional methods like self-reported questionnaire surveys is challenging. With the development of the Internet, social media platforms are considered powerful tools for identifying and understanding individuals at risk. This study comprehensively examines suicide-related content on Twitter. First, we collect 120,000 suicide-related tweets, along with author details and engagement data. Then, SuiBERT, a specialized BERT model for detecting suicidal content, is developed. Afterwards, dimensional emotional scores (valence and arousal) are calculated using a lexicon-based approach. Last, we conduct pattern and regression analyses to explore the relationships between emotional dimensions, engagement, and suicidality. Remarkably, SuiBERT achieves an accuracy of 90.92\% and a recall of 90.40\%. The results of pattern analysis indicate tweets with suicidal thoughts demonstrate lower levels of emotional positivity and intensity, along with reduced engagement levels. Emotional scores positively correlated with engagement size but negatively with conversion rates. Besides, Suicidal individuals tend to write shorter posts, have smaller social circles, and express more suicidality at 1:00 and 7:00. Topics in suicidal tweets revolve around personal emotions, while non-suicidal tweets mostly focus on social issues.
