Hi! Welcome to my website! 
:smiling_face_with_open_hands:<br>
{{< /lead >}}
I am Anhui, I obtained my Master's degree in Business Administration: Digital Business (with distinction) from the [Amsterdam Business School](https://abs.uva.nl/) at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/).<br>

My primary research interest lies in utilising machine learning techniques to gain insights from online data and reveal inherent patterns with a specific focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its applications in downstream suicide prevention efforts.<br>

I created this website to share what I have learned and what I love. You can explore the [projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}) to take a look at the data science-related projects I have done or am currently working on. You can also find some [summaries]({{< ref "posts" >}}) covering computer science-related knowledge, such as `machine learning`, `git`, `website`, that I've acquired and believe might be helpful. Using the [Tags]({{< ref "tags" >}}) button at the bottom left, you can easily find content that aligns with your interests based on different topics.<br>
