Hi! Welcome to my website! 
:smiling_face_with_open_hands:<br>
{{< /lead >}}
I am Anhui, I obtained my Master's degree in Business Administration: Digital Business (with distinction) from the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/). My primary research interest focuses on the application and refinement of machine learning models for downstream descriptive and predictive tasks, as well as the development and deployment of prescriptive analytics that can generate actionable insights from online user data.<br>

I created this website to share what I love and what I have learned. You can explore the [projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}) to take a look at the data science-related projects I have done or am currently working on. I wrote some [summaries]({{< ref "posts" >}}), such as `machine learning`, `data science`, `git`, which I believe might be fun and useful. You can also explore via [Tags]({{< ref "tags" >}}) to help you easily find topics that align with your interests.<br>
