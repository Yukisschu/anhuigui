# From Tweets to Insights:
## A BERT-Based Comprehensive Analysis of the Emotion Dimensions, Engagement Level and Topic Patterns in Suicide-Related Discourse on Twitter

***Abstract***
Suicide is a major global concern as a leading cause of mortality and social media platforms play an important role in
detecting suicidal ideation and understanding the nuances of suicidal expressions. This research introduces SuiBERT,
a semi-supervised fine-tuned BERT model, for identifying suicidal content in a dataset of 12,000 tweets. Remarkably,
SuiBERT achieves a 90.92% accuracy and 90.40% recall. The results of pattern analysis indicate tweets with suicidal
thoughts demonstrate lower levels of emotional positivity and intensity, along with reduced engagement levels, when
compared with their non-suicidal counterparts. Notably, the emotional valence and arousal scores show a significant
impact on engagement metricsâ€”positive correlations appear between emotion scores and engagement size, while negative
correlations are observed with engagement conversion rates. Furthermore, individuals with suicidal thoughts tend to
write shorter posts with fewer emotional words included, have smaller social circles, and experience peaks in suicidal
expressions around 1:00 and 7:00. Suicidal tweets primarily revolve around topic categories that reflect personal emotions
and situations. Conversely, non-suicidal counterparts exhibit an interest in social issues like LGBTQ, politics and violence,
displaying notably higher engagement levels. This study employs the state-of-the-art fine-tuned deep learning model,
BERT, within the context of suicide. The findings offer insight into the interplay between suicidal tendencies, emotional
dimensions, and engagement levels, examined both quantitatively and proportionally. Moreover, this study reveals
notable patterns and influential topics within suicide-related tweets, providing valuable insights into the development of
comprehensive suicide prevention strategies for all stakeholders.
