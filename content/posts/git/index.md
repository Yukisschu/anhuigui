When I asked Juju, "What is your favourite programming language?" Git was one of the answers I received. Afterwards, I was onboarded. After gaining a general understanding of Git, I was impressed by its power and conciseness. This led me to write a blog documenting some common Git commands, and it will be updated every time I refresh my knowledge about Git.

P.S. Here is a fun website also recommended by Juju, [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/), which visualizes Git operations. Most importantly, it does not require an internet connection (It became my good pal during travels in Switzerland when I had no internet on the train! :P).
